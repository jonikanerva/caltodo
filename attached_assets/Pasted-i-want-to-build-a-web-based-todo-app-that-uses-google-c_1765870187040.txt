i want to build a web based todo app that uses google calendar as the backend. 

# features

* i want to log in with google signin, and request read/write access to google calendar. 
* site should have a main view and a settings view.
* settings view should have me select the calendar i want to use, my work hours (start, end) and timezone, default todo item duration (i.e. 1h, 30min), and the color for the events that should be saved in google calendar as well. 
* main view should have a "create a task" input at the top. then below a todo list view of uncompleted tasks with checkboxes to complete them. below a collapsed (collapsable) list of completed tasks in descending order (last completed at top) and a button to "redo" it (i.e. put it back as uncompleted state)
* but the idea here is that when i add an item, it looks for the first free time slot from my google calender to fit the required duration (i.e. 1h) and puts that task there. so i have the time to do the task in my calendar. 
* the event in the calendar should have two links in the description. one that by clicking that the task is marked as done. and another that by clicking it it'd be resheduled for the next available free slot.
* also there should be a cron job that runs on the server that reshedules all the task at midnight again. so that if there are uncompleted tasks in the history, those are moved to the next day that they get done. 
* the task list on the website should also allow dragging the items to change the order of the tasks. so that the topmost always is sheduled to the first possible time slot. 
* the "create a task" input should also have a checkbox "urgent" and when enabled the task will to to the top and everything is rescheduled so that the task gets the first free slot. else new tasks go to the bottom
* this app should only touch calendar events in the calendar that are created by this app. so if the calendar has other events, those should always be left in place. 
* user settings, and the relations betweeb calendar entries and tasks, should be stored in a database on the server. task details should be in google calendar event details
* the "create a task" input field data should go as the calendar event title. and there should be another text area for "details" that should be saved in the calender event description/details field. those details should persist when the task are resheduled.
